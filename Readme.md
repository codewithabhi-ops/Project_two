# Readme file for project_two

This file includes the information about your project. In this case this project is just to explore more on git and github 
so that i have a better understanding how github works and get clarity upon some topics like making connections with other applications like Jenkins for CI 
and other applications that need to clone repository of our project from github or need an access to the working repository 
where they need to upload some of their files in our repository for example jenkinsfile
